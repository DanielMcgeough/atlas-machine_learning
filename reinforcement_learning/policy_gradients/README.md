In Reinforcement Learning (RL), Policy Gradients are a class of algorithms that directly optimize the agent's policy by estimating the gradient of the expected reward (or return) with respect to the policy's parameters. Unlike value-based methods (like Q-learning or SARSA) that first learn a value function and then derive a policy from it, policy gradient methods directly learn the mapping from states to actions.

Core Idea
The fundamental idea behind policy gradient methods is to adjust the policy parameters in a way that increases the probability of taking actions that lead to higher rewards and decreases the probability of actions that lead to lower rewards.

Parametrized Policy: The agent's policy, often denoted as π 
θ
​
 (a∣s), is represented by a parameterized function (e.g., a neural network). Here, θ represents the parameters (weights and biases of the network). This policy outputs a probability distribution over actions given a state.
Objective Function: The goal is to maximize the expected cumulative reward (return) an agent receives by following its policy. This is often formulated as an objective function J(θ).
Gradient Ascent: To maximize J(θ), policy gradient algorithms use gradient ascent. They calculate the gradient of the objective function with respect to the policy parameters, ∇ 
θ
​
 J(θ), and then update the parameters in the direction of this gradient: θ←θ+α∇ 
θ
​
 J(θ), where α is the learning rate.
Policy Gradient Theorem: A crucial theoretical result, the Policy Gradient Theorem, provides a way to compute this gradient without needing to differentiate through the environment's dynamics, which are often unknown. It states that the gradient of the expected return can be expressed as an expectation over trajectories:

Where:
τ is a trajectory (sequence of states, actions, and rewards).

​
 (a

  in state s

  under policy π

G

  is the return (cumulative discounted reward) from time step t onwards.
The ∇

​
 (a

 ∣s

​
 ) term is often called the "score function." It indicates how to change the parameters to make the action a 
t
​
  more or less likely.
In essence, this formula tells us to increase the probability of actions that lead to high returns (G 
t
​
 >0) and decrease the probability of actions that lead to low returns (G 
t
​
 <0).

How They Work (Simplified)
Rollout Trajectories: The agent interacts with the environment, following its current policy π 
θ
​
 , to collect one or more complete trajectories (episodes).
Compute Returns: For each trajectory, calculate the total cumulative discounted reward (G 
t
​
 ) for each time step.
Estimate Gradient: Use the collected trajectories and their returns to estimate the policy gradient, often by averaging the product of the score function and the return over the sampled time steps.
Update Policy: Update the policy parameters θ using an optimizer (like Adam or SGD) in the direction of the estimated gradient.
Repeat: Continue this process for many episodes until the policy converges to an optimal or near-optimal behavior.
Advantages of Policy Gradient Methods
Handle Continuous Action Spaces: Policy gradient methods can naturally handle continuous action spaces by having the policy output parameters of a probability distribution (e.g., mean and standard deviation for a Gaussian distribution), from which actions are sampled. Value-based methods often struggle with continuous action spaces as they rely on finding the maximum value among a discrete set of actions.
Learn Stochastic Policies: They can learn stochastic policies (where actions are chosen probabilistically), which can be beneficial in environments with inherent randomness or where optimal behavior requires exploration. Deterministic policies might get stuck in local optima in such environments.
Better Convergence Properties: In some cases, policy gradient methods can have better convergence properties compared to value-based methods, as they perform updates directly on the policy, leading to more stable learning.
Direct Policy Optimization: By directly optimizing the policy, they can be more suitable for tasks where the "best" action isn't necessarily the one with the highest Q-value but rather a strategic choice in a complex environment.
Disadvantages of Policy Gradient Methods
High Variance: Policy gradient estimates often suffer from high variance, meaning that the gradient computed from a single or a few trajectories can be noisy. This can lead to slow and unstable training.
Sample Inefficiency: Due to high variance, they often require a large number of samples (interactions with the environment) to learn effectively, making them less sample-efficient than some value-based or off-policy methods.
Local Optima: While capable of learning stochastic policies, they are still susceptible to converging to local optima rather than the global optimum.
Sensitivity to Hyperparameters: They can be sensitive to hyperparameter choices, such as the learning rate and the discount factor.
Common Policy Gradient Algorithms
REINFORCE (Monte Carlo Policy Gradient): The simplest policy gradient algorithm, which uses the entire episode's return to estimate the gradient.
Actor-Critic Methods: Combine policy gradients (the "actor" learns the policy) with value-based methods (a "critic" learns a value function to reduce variance in the policy gradient estimates). Examples include A2C (Advantage Actor-Critic) and A3C (Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic).
Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO): An algorithm designed to address the stability issues of basic policy gradients by enforcing a "trust region" constraint on policy updates to prevent drastic changes.
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO): A popular and widely used algorithm that simplifies TRPO by using a clipped objective function to constrain policy updates, offering a good balance between performance and implementation complexity.
Policy gradient methods form a crucial part of modern deep reinforcement learning, particularly for tasks involving continuous control or complex decision-making, and are the foundation for many state-of-the-art algorithms.
