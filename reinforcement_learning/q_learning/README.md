## Description

Q-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that learns an optimal policy by estimating the action-value function (Q-function).  The Q-function represents the expected future reward of taking a specific action in a given state. This implementation provides a basic framework for understanding and experimenting with Q-learning.  It is intended for educational purposes and may be adapted for various reinforcement learning environments.

## Key Features

* **Tabular Q-learning:** Implements Q-learning using a table to store Q-values.
* **Epsilon-Greedy Exploration:** Balances exploration and exploitation using the epsilon-greedy strategy.
* **Basic Environment Interface:** Includes a simple interface for defining reinforcement learning environments.
* **Clear and Commented Code:** The code is written to be easy to understand, with detailed comments.
* **Example Usage:** Provides a simple example of how to use the Q-learning algorithm.

## Dependencies

* Python 3.x
* NumPy (for numerical operations)

    You can install the dependencies using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install numpy
    ```

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/q-learning-repository.git](https://github.com/your-username/q-learning-repository.git)
    cd q-learning-repository
    ```

2.  (Optional) Create a virtual environment (recommended):

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt # If you have a requirements.txt, otherwise install dependencies individually
    ```

## Usage

1.  Define your reinforcement learning environment by creating a class that inherits from the provided environment interface (see `environment.py` for an example, if included).  At a minimum, your environment should define:
    * The state space.
    * The action space.
    * The transition function (how the environment changes state based on actions).
    * The reward function (what feedback the agent receives).
    * A way to determine if the episode is done.

2.  Instantiate the Q-learning agent and the environment.

3.  Train the agent by repeatedly interacting with the environment, updating the Q-table based on the observed rewards and state transitions.

4.  Evaluate the trained agent by running it in the environment without exploration (i.e., always choosing the greedy action).

A basic example is shown below

## Examples

```python
import numpy as np

# Define a simple environment (e.g., a grid world)
class SimpleGridWorld:
    def __init__(self, width, height, start_state, goal_state):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height
        self.start_state = start_state
        self.goal_state = goal_state
        self.current_state = start_state
        self.action_space = ['up', 'down', 'left', 'right']

    def get_state(self):
        return self.current_state

    def get_available_actions(self):
        return self.action_space

    def take_action(self, action):
        x, y = self.current_state
        if action == 'up':
            y = max(0, y - 1)
        elif action == 'down':
            y = min(self.height - 1, y + 1)
        elif action == 'left':
            x = max(0, x - 1)
        elif action == 'right':
            x = min(self.width - 1, x + 1)
        self.current_state = (x, y)

        if self.current_state == self.goal_state:
          reward = 10
          done = True
        else:
          reward = -1
          done = False

        return self.current_state, reward, done

    def reset(self):
        self.current_state = self.start_state
        return self.current_state

# Initialize environment and agent
env = SimpleGridWorld(width=5, height=5, start_state=(0, 0), goal_state=(4, 4))
num_states = (env.width * env.height)
num_actions = len(env.action_space)
q_table = np.zeros((num_states, num_actions))  # Initialize Q-table
alpha = 0.1  # Learning rate
gamma = 0.9  # Discount factor
epsilon = 0.1  # Exploration rate
num_episodes = 1000

def state_to_index(state, width):
    return state[0] + state[1] * width

# Q-learning algorithm
for episode in range(num_episodes):
    state = env.reset()
    done = False

    while not done:
        state_index = state_to_index(state, env.width)
        # Epsilon-greedy action selection
        if np.random.rand() < epsilon:
            action_index = np.random.choice(num_actions)
            action = env.action_space[action_index]
        else:
            action_index = np.argmax(q_table[state_index, :])
            action = env.action_space[action_index]

        next_state, reward, done = env.take_action(action)
        next_state_index = state_to_index(next_state, env.width)

        # Q-table update
        q_table[state_index, action_index] = q_table[state_index, action_index] + alpha * (
            reward + gamma * np.max(q_table[next_state_index, :]) - q_table[state_index, action_index]
        )
        state = next_state

    if (episode + 1) % 100 == 0:
        print(f"Episode {episode + 1} finished")
print("Q-Table: ")
print(q_table)
