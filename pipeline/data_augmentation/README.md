Data augmentation is a powerful technique used in machine learning, especially for image and text data, to artificially expand the size and diversity of a training dataset. Instead of collecting new real-world examples, it generates modified versions of existing data points by applying various transformations, such as randomly rotating, flipping, or cropping images, or subtly altering phrases in text. This process helps models become more robust and generalize better to unseen data by exposing them to a wider range of variations, ultimately reducing the risk of overfitting and improving performance without requiring more original data collection.
