A database is an organized collection of data, designed for efficient storage, retrieval, and management. Historically, relational databases (RDBMS) have been dominant, organizing data into structured tables with predefined schemas, rows, and columns. These tables are linked through common fields (keys), allowing for complex queries using SQL and ensuring strong data consistency via ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties. RDBMS are ideal for highly structured data where integrity and relationships are paramount, like financial transactions.

In contrast, non-relational databases (NoSQL) emerged to handle the diverse, unstructured, and rapidly growing data of modern applications. Unlike relational databases, NoSQL databases offer flexible schemas and store data in various formats, such as documents, key-value pairs, wide columns, or graphs. They prioritize scalability and availability over strict consistency (often achieving "eventual consistency"), making them suitable for big data, real-time analytics, and applications with evolving data requirements. The choice between relational and non-relational depends heavily on the specific data structure, consistency needs, and scalability demands of an application.
