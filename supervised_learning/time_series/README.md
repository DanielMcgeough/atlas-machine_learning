The Purpose of this project is to solidify our understanding of a RNN and how forecasting works with a real world example that works within the bounds of a series, divided by
hour in this case. 
We will create a preprocess data file to get a
stationary dataset as well as fetch and
organize the dataset to give the model the
best dataset in order to train in an efficent
and effective way.
Then we will execute the time series to run
with the forecastbtc function which will give
us a clearer picture after which we will fine
tune parameters in order to make it accurate.
