Requirements
General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.9)
Your files will be executed with numpy (version 1.25.2)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.11.1)
All your modules should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
All your classes should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
Unless otherwise noted, you are not allowed to import any module except import numpy as np
Unless otherwise noted, you are not allowed to use any loops (for, while, etc.)
All your files must be executable
The length of your files will be tested using wc

This is the README for the Classification Using Neural Networks Project for he Atlas School machine learning specialization. Classification using Neural Networks is the process of being fed raw data, in the case of the project it was to analyze hand drawn numbers and to classify them with a high degree of accuracy which number between 0-9 they represented. It was a first step into creating a supervised learning model which would be a foundation for more challenging classification models of greater size and more accuracy. For anyone interested in Machine Learning this is the first foray into a process known as computer vision, or how a machine tends to perceive things that humans do with their eyes. While we can identify objects easily, for a computer it needs to follow a pattern in order to make sense of the data. During this project the requirements were listed above and the questions to be answered were also included.
