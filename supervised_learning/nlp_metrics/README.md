NLP model evaluation relies on diverse metrics tailored to specific tasks. For text generation, BLEU and ROUGE assess fluency and content overlap with reference texts, focusing on n-gram matching and recall respectively. Classification tasks often use accuracy, precision, recall, and the balanced F1-score to measure correctness and identify biases. Specialized tasks like question answering and language modeling employ metrics like exact match and perplexity for targeted evaluation. The choice of metric is crucial for accurately gauging model performance and guiding development in NLP.
