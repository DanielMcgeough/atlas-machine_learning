The point of this project is to experience the best ways to optimize a model effectively. First, the research materials covered manually changing one hyperparamter at a time like learning rate or epoch number. It is important to use orthogonal hyperparamters or ones that only have one responsibility. Then we learned about different method or functions that would allow us to optimize models. We learned about random and grid search (fast but not fully optimized) and Bayesian optimization which seemed like the best method. We they were taught about a couple of libraries that would allow us to use Gaussian Processes in order to arrive at the best outcome for models. Sometimes the best outcome relies on accuracy numbers or meeting minimum/maximum requirements. There are various ways to find the best "classifier" or model most of which are explored throughout this project.
