What are Autoencoders?
Autoencoders are neural networks designed to learn compressed, encoded representations of data. They consist of two main parts:

Encoder: Compresses the input data into a lower-dimensional latent space.
Decoder: Reconstructs the original input data from the latent space representation.
The goal is to train the network to minimize the difference between the input and the reconstructed output. This forces the network to learn efficient representations of the data.

Key Concepts
Latent Space: The compressed representation of the input data.
Reconstruction Loss: The difference between the input and the reconstructed output (e.g., Mean Squared Error, Cross-Entropy).
Undercomplete Autoencoders: Autoencoders where the latent space has a lower dimensionality than the input space, forcing the network to learn the most important features.
Sparse Autoencoders: Autoencoders that introduce sparsity constraints in the latent space, encouraging the network to learn more meaningful representations.
Variational Autoencoders (VAEs): Generative models that learn a probability distribution over the latent space, allowing for the generation of new data samples.
Denoising Autoencoders: Autoencoders trained to reconstruct clean data from noisy inputs, improving robustness.
Applications
Autoencoders have a wide range of applications, including:

Dimensionality Reduction: Reducing the number of features in a dataset while preserving important information.
Image Compression: Compressing images for efficient storage and transmission.
Anomaly Detection: Identifying data points that deviate significantly from the learned representation.
Image Denoising: Removing noise from images.
Generative Modeling (VAEs): Generating new data samples similar to the training data.
Feature Learning: Learning meaningful features from unlabeled data.
Loss Functions
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Commonly used for continuous data, measuring the average squared difference between the input and the reconstructed output.
Cross-Entropy: Used for categorical data, measuring the difference between the input and the reconstructed probability distributions.
Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KL Divergence): Used in VAEs to measure the difference between the learned latent distribution and a prior distribution.
